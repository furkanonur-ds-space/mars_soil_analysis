# Curiosity Rover's Martian Path: A Geospatial Analysis of Soil Chemistry

This project provides an interactive geospatial visualization of the Curiosity rover's journey in Gale Crater, Mars. By integrating the rover's location data with its soil chemistry analysis, the project maps the rover's path and allows for the exploration of chemical compositions at specific points of interest. The final output is an interactive map, generated using Plotly, that enables a detailed view of the rover's discoveries.

### Key Features
- **Data Integration:** Merges geospatial and chemical analysis data from multiple sources.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Creates a dynamic and interactive map of the rover's path.
- **Detailed Tooltips:** Displays comprehensive information for each data point, including location coordinates, sol number, and 16 different chemical compositions.
- **Custom Map Layer:** Utilizes a custom, high-resolution image of the Gale Crater as the base map for precise data plotting.
